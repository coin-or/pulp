Basic Python Coding
===================

In this course you will learn basic programming in Python, but there is also 
excellent Python Language reference material available on the internet freely. 
You can download the book `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.org/>`_ 
or there are a host of `Beginners Guides <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_
to Python on the Python Website. Follow the links to either:

+ `BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers>`_ 
+ `BeginnersGuide/Programmers <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers>`_
 
depending on your level of current programming knowledge. The code sections 
below assume a knowledge of fundamental programming principles and mainly 
focus on Syntax specific to programming in Python.

Note: >>> represents a Python command line prompt.


Loops in Python
---------------

for Loop
~~~~~~~~

The general format is:


.. code-block::  python

    for variable in sequence:
        #some commands
    #other commands after for loop


Note that the formatting (indents and new lines) governs the end of the for 
loop, whereas the start of the loop is the colon :.

Observe the loop below, which is similar to loops you will be using in the 
course. The variable i moves through the string list becoming each string in 
turn. The top section is the code in a .py file and the bottom section shows 
the output

.. code-block::  python

    #The following code demonstrates a list with strings
    ingredientslist = ["Rice","Water","Jelly"]
    for i in ingredientslist: 
        print i
    print "No longer in the loop"

gives

.. code-block::  python

    Rice
    Water
    Jelly
    No longer in the loop


while Loop
~~~~~~~~~~

These are similar to for loops except they continue to loop until the specified 
condition is no longer true. A while loop is not told to work through any 
specific sequence.


.. code-block::  python

    i = 3
    while i <= 15:
        # some commands
        i = i + 1 # a command that will eventually end the loop is naturally 
        required
    # other commands after while loop


For this specific simple while loop, it would have been better to do as a for 
loop but it demonstrates the syntax. while loops are useful if the number of 
iterations before the loop needs to end, is unknown.

The if statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is performed in much the same way as the loops above. The key identifier is
the colon : to start the statements and the end of indentation to end it.


.. code-block::  python

    if j in testlist:
        # some commands
    elif j == 5:
        # some commands
    else:
        # some commands


Here it is shown that "elif" (else if) and "else" can also be used after an if 
statement. "else" can in fact be used after both the loops in the same way.

Array types in python
--------------------------

Lists
~~~~~

A list is simply a sequence of variables grouped together. The range function is
often used to create lists of integers, with the general format of 
range(start,stop,step). The default for start is 0 and the default for step is 
1.


>>> range(3,8)
[3,4,5,6,7]


This is a list/sequence. As well as integers, lists can also have strings in 
them or a mix of integers, floats and strings. They can be created by a loop 
(as shown in the next section) or by explicit creation (below). Note that the 
print statement will display a string/variable/list/... to the user


>>> a = [5,8,"pt"]
>>> print a
[5,8,'pt']
>>> print a[0]
5

Tuples
~~~~~~

Tuples are basically the same as lists, but with the important difference that 
they cannot be modified once they have been created. They are assigned by:


>>> x = (4,1,8,"string",[1,0],("j",4,"o"),14)


Tuples can have any type of number, strings, lists, other tuples, functions and 
objects, inside them. Also note that the first element in the tuple is numbered 
as element "zero". Accessing this data is done by:


>>> x[0]
4
>>> x[3]
"string"


Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Dictionary is a list of reference keys each with associated data, whereby the 
order does not affect the operation of the dictionary at all. With dictionaries,
the keys are not consecutive integers (unlike lists), and instead could be 
integers, floats or strings. This will become clear:


>>> x = {} # creates a new empty dictionary - note the curly brackets denoting the creation of a dictionary
>>> x[4] = "programming" # the string "programming" is added to the dictionary x, with "4" as it's reference
>>> x["games"] = 12
>>> print x["games"]
12


In a dictionary, the reference keys and the stored values can be any type of 
input. New dictionary elements are added as they are created (with a list, you 
cannot access or write to a place in the list that exceeds the initially defined
list dimensions).


.. code-block::  python

    costs = {"CHICKEN": 1.3, "BEEF": 0.8, "MUTTON": 12}
    print "Cost of Meats" 
    for i in costs: 
        print i 
        print costs[i]
    costs["LAMB"] = 5
    print "Updated Costs of Meats" 
    for i in costs: 
        print i 
        print costs[i]

gives

.. code-block::  python

    Cost of Meats
    CHICKEN
    1.3
    MUTTON
    12
    BEEF
    0.8
    Updated Costs of Meats
    LAMB
    5
    CHICKEN
    1.3
    MUTTON
    12
    BEEF
    0.8


In the above example, the dictionary is created using curly brackets and colons 
to represent the assignment of data to the dictionary keys. The variable i is 
assigned to each of the keys in turn (in the same way it would be for a list 
with 

>>> for i in range(1,10)

). Then the dictionary is called with this key, and 
it returns the data stored under that key name. These types of for loops using 
dictionaries will be highly relevant in using PuLP to model LPs in this course.

List/Tuple/Dictionary Syntax Note
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the creation of a: 

- list is done with square brackets [];
- tuple is done with round brackets and a comma (,);  
- dictionary is done with parentheses{}.

After creation however, when accessing elements in the list/tuple/dictionary, 
the operation is always performed with square brackets (i.e a[3]?). If a was a 
list or tuple, this would return the fourth element. If a was a dictionary it 
would return the data stored with a reference key of 3.

List Comprehensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python supports List Comprehensions which are a fast and concise way to create
lists without using multiple lines. They are easily understandable when simple,
and you will be using them in your code for this course.


>>> a = [i for i in range(5)]
>>> a
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


This statement above will create the list [0,1,2,3,4] and assign it to the 
variable "a".


>>> odds = [i for i in range(25) if i%2==1]
>>> odds
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23]

This statement above uses the if statement and the modulus operator(%) so that 
only odd numbers are included in the list: [1,3,5,...,19,21,23]. (Note: The 
modulus operator calculates the remainder from an integer division.)


>>> fifths = [i for i in range(25) if i%5==0]
>>> fifths
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20]

This will create a list with every fifth value in it [0,5,10,15,20]. Existing 
lists can also be used in the creation of new lists below:

>>> a = [i for i in range(25) if (i in odds and i not in fifths)]


Note that this could also have been done in one step from scratch:

>>> a = [i for i in range(25) if (i%2==1 and i%5==0)]

For a challenge you can try creating 

a. a list of prime numbers up to 100, and 
#. a list of all "perfect" numbers.

Other important language features
---------------------------------

Commenting in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commenting at the top of a file is done using """ to start and to end the 
comment section. Commenting done throughout the code is done using the hash 
# symbol at the start of the line.

Import Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the top of all your Python coding that you intend to use PuLP to model, you 
will need the import statement. This statement makes the contents of another 
module (file of program code) available in the module you are currently writing 
i.e. functions and values defined in pulp.py that you will be required to call, 
become usable. In this course you will use:

>>> from pulp import *

The asterisk represents that you are importing all names from the module of 
pulp. Calling a function defined in pulp.py now can be done as if they were 
defined in your own module.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

Functions in Python are defined by: (def is short for define)

.. code-block::  python

    def name(inputparameter1, inputparameter2, . . .):
        #function body

For a real example, note that if inputs are assigned a value in the function 
definition, that is the default value, and will be used only if no other value 
is passed in. The order of the input parameters (in the definition) does not 
matter at all, as long as when the function is called, the positional parameters
are entered in the corresponding order. If keywords are used the order of the
parameters does not matter at all:

.. code-block::  python

    def string_appender(head='begin', tail='end', end_message='EOL'):
        result = head + tail + end_message
        return result

>>> string_appender('newbegin', end_message = 'StringOver')
newbeginendStringOver

In the above example, the output from the function call is printed. The default 
value for head is 'begin', but instead the input of 'newbegin' was used. The
default value for tail of 'end' was used. And the input value of endmessage was
used. Note that end_message must be specified as a key word argument as no 
value is given for tail

Classes
~~~~~~~

To demonstrate how classes work in Python, look at the following class structure.

The class name is Pattern, and it contains several class variables which are 
relevant to any instance of the Pattern class (i.e a Pattern). The functions are

__init__ 
    function which creates an instance of the Pattern 
    class and assigns the attributes of name and lengthsdict using self.

__str__ 
    function defines what to return if the class instance is printed.

trim 
    function acts like any normal function, except as with all class functions, 
    self must be in the input brackets.

.. code-block::  python

    class Pattern:
        """
        Information on a specific pattern in the SpongeRoll Problem
        """
        cost = 1
        trimValue = 0.04
        totalRollLength = 20
        lenOpts = [5, 7, 9]

    def __init__(self,name,lengths = None): 
        self.name = name 
        self.lengthsdict = dict(zip(self.lenOpts,lengths))

    def __str__(self): 
        return self.name

    def trim(self): 
    return Pattern.totalRollLength - sum([int(i)*self.lengthsdict[i] for i in self.lengthsdict])

This class could be used as follows:

>>> Pattern.cost # The class attributes can be accessed without making an instance of the class
1
>>> a = Pattern("PatternA",[1,0,1])
>>> a.cost # a is now an instance of the Pattern class and is associated with Pattern class variables
1
>>> print a # This calls the Pattern.__str__() function
"PatternA"
>>> a.trim() # This calls the Pattern.trim() function. Note that no input is required. 

The self in the function definition is an implied input
