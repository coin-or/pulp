Installing PuLP at Home
=======================

PuLP is a free open source software written in Python. It is used to describe 
optimisation problems as mathematical models. PuLP can then call any of numerous
external LP solvers (CBC, GLPK, CPLEX, Gurobi etc) to solve this model and then 
use python commands to manipulate and display the solution.
