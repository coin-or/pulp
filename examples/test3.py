# Deterministic generation planning using mixed integer linear programming.

# The goal is to minimise the cost of generation while satisfaying demand
# using a few thermal units and an hydro unit.
# The thermal units have a proportional cost and a startup cost.
# The hydro unit has an initial storage.
